File Descriptions:</br>
1. audio_feature_extraction.ipynb : This file contains all the feature extraction codes. We use this to train and test the performance of Classical Machine Learning code.</br>
2. Classical ML Algo.ipynb: Files contain codes for all the classical ML Classification Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Multi-Layer perceptron, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.</br>
3. LSTM MFCC_40.ipynb : This file contains the code for LSTM as an ML model and 40 MFCC as input to the model.</br>
4. Spectogram-LSTM.ipynb : This file contains the code for LSTM as an ML model and the Spectrogram image as input to the model.</br>
5. Final Feature SER: This file contains the extracted feature. We use these feature values in our classical ML Algorithms. </br>
